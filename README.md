Project is to create a program where a user can enter a 
topic to search Wikipedia's page for it. This is done in using two 
separate methods; either the command-line or the GUI. The user can use 
the command line simply by running Main. If the user wants to use the GUI, 
they can hit "run" under "application" from the Gradle tab. The program will 
then take the recent revisions made on the specific topic the user entered 
and format them. The user should see the program spit out a number of timestamps 
and users that recently revised the page they looked for. This output will 
show up either on the command line or the GUI, depending on what the user
chose to run.
