Project is to create a program where a user can enter a 
topic to search Wikipedia's page for it. The program will then take the recent 
revisions made on that specific topic and format them. The user should see 
the program spit out a number of timestamps and users that recently revised 
the page they looked for. The user should also be able to run the program with
the UI if they hit the "run" button under application from the Gradle tab.
